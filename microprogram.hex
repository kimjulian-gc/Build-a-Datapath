# This file holds the microprogram data that you should load into your
# datapath's Microprogram ROM. Each row holds a 16-bit value that you will
# break into control signals to execute an instruction with a given opcode.
# As you implement additional opcodes you will need to change the hexadecimal
# values below. Don't forget to add comments that describe the control signals
# each opcode is configured to send.
